"A few years ago I was trying to get into building my own small systems. I had successfully created a NAS and a Pi-hole (not exactly rocket science) and my next project was going to be a Hackintosh. I bought a $500 Chinese NUC (Lattepanda) and somehow managed to install Catalina on it and managed to run it (which was crazy to me since it had required some iffy config that I didn't think I'd be able to get down). I then went through the trouble of building this thing into a suitcase so that it was a ""laptop"", though decidedly bare bones. The next time I powered it up, it promptly burned through something, powered off, and I now had a $800 suitcase brick. That one slapped me down so hard from my techy fantasies that I put away my tools and never touched another project again. My NAS & Pi-hole also stopped working after a few months, and I decided that that was enough of a sign from the universe that I wasn't meant to be wasting my time, money and effort on something I was decidedly not intelligent or strong-willed enough to see to fruition. I was also hoping to make it my ""out"" of support work which I've been doing for almost two decades. But with that project died my dreams of being able to rise above my own limitations as well, since I've repeatedly proven to myself that whenever I try my hardest at something, I'll simply still fail eventually."

Half Life: Alyx for example is widely considered the ""Best"" VR game. Many would agree it's the best Action VR game, but it wouldn't be the ""Best"" for puzzles. To make it easier I'll list the types of [Genres for Video Games from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres). Please do give suggestions for some of the highest quality games you've played from various categories: - **Action:** Platform games, shooter, fighting, survival, etc - **Action-Adventure:** Survival horror - **Adventure:** Interactive, real time, 3d, text adventures, etc - **Puzzle:** Exploration, trial and error, breakout, logical games, etc - **Role-playing:** Action RPG, MMORPG, tactical, sandbox, etc - **Simulation:** Management, life simulation, vehicle simulation, etc - **Strategy:** Real time, turn based, wargame, grand strategy, etc - **Sports:** Racing, competitive, sports games, etc - **MMO:** Massively multiplayer online game - **Openworld:** Sandbox, creative, open world, etc Note: Non-exhaustive category list. There are more such as card games, board games, etc. Please check the wiki link above for more categories to get ideas for the ""best"" games. I personally would recommend Subnautica (Open World), Half Life: Alyx (VR Action-Adventure), The Witcher 3 (Role-playing), Black Mesa (Action), Titanfall 2 (Action), Portal 2 (Puzzle), Battlebit (MMO/Action), and Half Life 3 (Fictional Game)."

"Hard disagree. There are trade-offs for both, but the movie-going experience can't be beat. The large screen and the atmosphere cannot be replicated at home unless you want to literally build an actual theater in your basement. And even then it's a pale comparison. But a decent home theater had the benefits of not dealing with crowds. Not paying concession stand prices. Watching when you want. And not driving. But arguably all those points (aside from the price) are also benefits as part of the experience. I saw Dune in the theaters and it was the first time in years because of covid. There's no way that movie would have the same impact of I watched it at home. This is something people don't appreciate about at home vs theaters. Most movies are filmed and framed for an extremely large screen, like a theater. Unless you have a large 80""+ screen at home, it doesn't have the same effect. You can see the difference by comparing the framing of TV shows to movies. Especially shows from 10+ years ago, as more modern shows have started to accommodate the sightly larger average 40"" screen. But you still see the TV show style framing in modern shows. One example I'm thinking of is the Wheel of Time show. Many of the shots of the characters were full face close up shots. In a movie meant for theater screens those shots would have been a bit further back. And full face close ups are reserved for emotional expression (like Dr Grants face in Jurassic Park when he first sees the brachiosaurus). Ultimately, going to the theaters is awesome."

Fewer posts across many of the front page subreddits, fewer votes, more bot posts, more low effort posts, less discussion in comment sections, lots of deleted comments and accounts... overall there just seems to be a dip in quality.

I get constant pop ups trying to direct me to download the app, then when I say no the website will auto reload, often sending me back to the top of the page. It's difficult to find and respond to anyone who replies to your comments, and sometimes if you sort by top: today it won't even show any posts. Just... blank. Clicking on a post opens it as a tab that is more like a popup, and closing it resets where you were on the page. I could keep going but I think that pretty much summarizes what I've noticed.

Hate movements thrive when left unchecked to fester and grow.

And it's not so crushing. It just takes time. A great analogy I heard once is to imagine you have a box which represents a past source of grief, and in that box is a button and a ball. As we go about life, the box gets jostled and bumped by things that remind us of our grief. This moves the ball around and every time the ball hits the button it brings on the feelings of grief and sadness. The size of the ball shrinks with time though. When we first go through something traumatic our ball is very large, taking up most of the space in the box, so very small events bump the button, and it's going to hit that grief button a lot at first. But over time as the ball shrinks. As it gets smaller, the jostling and bumping doesn't make the ball hit the grief button so much. It might even graze it without pushing it. We may always have that box, and that's ok. And that button may get to the point it gets hit once after 20 years. But that's OK too. The grief gets less with time. 🙂"	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

In time, she learned how to handle a meatsaber better than anyone in the Jedi Temple. She wore a miniskirt every day so we told her there were no panties in space, and since she was constantly doing acrobatics you’d get a glimpse of her orange pussy mid fight as she’d do a flip while slicing a B2 Super Battledroid in half.

"My son is afraid of reporting this to police because many of his friends work there, and he's afraid of retaliation at school for being a ""snitch"". This is not the first time he's witnessed something very wrong and had to report it, that time to police, and he was targeted at school both physically and just with asshole kids treating him the way they do (while also influencing others). Management made up an excuse and fired my son after it became apparent that he knew about the meth situation and was not ok with it. He does want corporate to know all of this and take action, so we plan to report it to them. Part of the trouble is this: My SO's daughter had a similar situation at another fast food joint, it was reported to corporate, and the response was basically ""we can't do anything because that location is a franchise"". The problem manager in that instance was promoted soon afterward. I'm not sure if my son's restaurant is corporate owned or franchise. If it's a franchise as I fear, and corporate will take no action, what recourse can we take without police? I'm super pissed my son was exposed to this and I'm concerned for the girl that informed him, not to mention the other employees. This obviously cannot stand, but I also don't want to ruin my son's social life over it. I remember being a high schooler, it's hard enough without being targeted by jerks. EDIT: Thank you for all the replies. I plan to wait awhile to give my son some distance, then contact police.

"My trigonometry teacher in high school had an extra credit corner. There were daily math puzzles and similar ways to get a couple of points here or there. I figured out that even if killed the rest of the term, I would finish with a low B. With the daily puzzles I could maybe bring my grade up to a more solid B, but an A was out of reach. Then I realized that one option was to bring in a cutout of a cartoon that had something to do with math. He was talking about cartoons from the newspaper, but this was in the 90s when digital media was starting to be a thing. I did a Yahoo! search for math cartoons and printed out hundreds of them. I printed anything that was even tangentially related and brought in a stack of papers an inch thick on the last day of class. It was enough. I got the grade by the slimiest of margins and the next year the extra credit corner had a 2-cartoon limit."	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

"Several. I'll keep it to three. One, was having to move out from my home state, twice. I have my fair share of criticism for some parts of it that I didn't like, like having been around some lowly leveled towns with druggies and drunks. But there have been an awful lot of ups as well, I love it's scenery, I love how it isn't billboard haven like the places I've moved to have had and I liked the small communities. As well as my state being a very progressive state too. If only it'd correct it's affordability problem, I would have loved to return there. Two, the changing of the internet. I've been online for over 27 years now. It is depressing to watch it all devolve into a corporate marketing playground with so many subscriptions nagging you. I've had to watch so many good places shut down because of these increasing pressures of these changes affecting them. People I've known online, are either gone due to the sands of time or that they've passed away that I didn't realize until I get second or third hand information about it. It used to all be a rich and fulfilling experience. But every time I use the internet now, it feels shallower and shallower. If the internet were to suddenly up and vanish in maybe the next 5 minutes, I wouldn't complain. I'd just bow out and feel that we've done all that we've done. Lastly, having to oust a friend of 5 years tenure for showing sympathy to pedophiles. They brought a lot of positivity and wholesomeness to my life during my time with them. We were even in a group with others that shared silliness and good times. But the past year it has been nothing but just senseless debates and one of which ended up them coming out as a pedo sympathizer which was something I just couldn't accept because of my experiences having been entangled with pedos and dealing with them and their illogical worldview on how they see minors."

"The reason it matters what's happening with reddit is the [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). Social media is a natural monopoly, and it seems to me that in general there is only one major platform for each type of content at any given time. Recently sites like reddit for link aggregation, facebook for I guess interpersonal groups, and twitter for microblogging have been those major platforms. They are taking huge hits lately, and if users migrate to the fediverse in enough volume, then they can be displaced permanently. Prople shifted from digg to reddit in a similar scandal years ago. Now, whether the fediverse will reach that critical mass remains to be seen, but I hope it does because it represents a more open and stable alternative that fundamentally can't be toppled by a single bad actor, unlike literally every centralised corporate platform out there. It has the potential to become an actual public town square like the internet seemed to promise decades ago. It might actually be in a position to topple the corporate monopolisation of our information ecosystem, and that's a huge deal. And the capacity for federation between the different types of social media offers the possibility that once the fediverse gets big enough it can extend that network effect across the different types and displace all corporate social media. Like at the moment peertube isn't huge partly because the server costs to grow to rival youtube are enormous. But if the fediverse becomes big enough, who knows? Maybe it will be in a position to take over as the main video sharing platform on the internet. We could say goodbye to all the youtube drama that impacts video creators today. So that's why it matters. Reddit isn't just a bad boss or an ex, they are a mafia controlling a large piece of territory, and whether we can push them out impacts our network and a lot more besides."

Think of it like family based charity. On the other hand if your Uncle is wasting money extravagantly, then there is no point in helping, because it will be - at best - wasted, and encourages the Uncle to continue wasting as much money as possible to always be in need to maximize the donations.

And potentially increase the odds for any survivors. Once we've made the environment safe for firefighters, searched for victims, and put the fire out, then we switch to preserving property. We don't want to open doors at this point. Rooms within a structure should be closed/isolated. We want heat/smoke/gases to be removed directly from the structure, not fed further into the structure. But yes, opening windows is a valid form of ventilation, we don't always need to break things. Once the fire is out, interior doors and fans absolutely help. Ventilation shouldn't be random, it should be coordinated with the interior attack team(s) so that it occurs closest to where they are working.

Watering troughs and rain barrels can be filled by water collected from barn and other out-building roofs.

However, the use of rainwater for supplying domestic water needs is not without its problems. > > > >Water quality is of concern especially when the rainwater is to be used for drinking purposes in addition to other domestic uses. Rainwater and atmospheric dust that are collected by roof catchments contain certain contaminants which may pose a health threat to those consuming the water. Lead and other pollutants may accumulate in cistern bottom sediments; and untreated rainwater is quite corrosive to plumbing systems. Measures must be taken to minimize these and other water-quality problems in cistern systems. Recommendations for doing this will be presented, as well as guidelines for designing and building roof-catchment cistern systems. > > > >Rainwater cisterns can provide water of adequate quantity and quality if proper steps are taken in the planning and construction stages, and periodic maintenance is performed throughout the life of the cistern.

because reddit has all of the content and ease of use while lemmy has neither and we want to see lemmy succeed.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
I think people are forgetting that Reddit didn't start off with communities (subs), they came later. Reddit got big the same way all sites that don't have a built in audience (e.g. Threads users basically being Insta users) - time and commitment.  Lemmy is not going to be as big as Reddit for a long, long time. Everyone has fallen into this habit of thinking all Reddit mods are power crazy egomaniacs and some are, no doubt, but the good subs on Reddit required dedicated time and effort to build up. Curating, introducing and constantly readjusting rules and expectations and at some point a good sub reaches a tipping point and it's popular.   All this will take time with Lemmy. Community mods will need to be as dedicated as Reddit mods were. And, as a side issue, this commitment to making and keeping a community great is what spez and his idiot gremlins have just thrown away. It's not about user numbers for Reddit, it's now a priority for them to get mods who are willing and able to put in the amount of work the mods they just alienated had. Subreddit engagement stats are mostly going down [take a look at the number of posts and the number of comments for r/askreddit](https://subredditstats.com/r/askreddit), it's a steady decline.  Lemmy might not *ever* get as big as Reddit but it will grow if mods stay committed and users keep posting and commenting. If that happens, that same tipping point will come.

What Lemmy needs: buy the top search term for the word Reddit in the Apple/Google app stores.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
I think social media designed like "Reddit" is just THE logical way to structure social media. That's why I think there is just an inherent demand for a platform like Reddit. Because of the network effect, social media platforms strongly tend to centralize. More users > more content > more users > more content > ... it is a self-reinforcing cycle favoring centralization. So that is the reason why reddit is popular, it was "the first", it is big. The only reason why people would ever leave is if Reddit themselves screw themselves over. Luckily for us, they do all the time.  Where Reddit really fails is how powerful admins and mods are, and regularly abusing that power. To fix this, you need to change the incentive structure so that power goes to the users themselves.  Lemmy is already better at this because of its federated structure.  But I would go a step further and make communities work more like git. Anyone can fork any communities, meaning they create a new copy of a community but under their management. If enough people switch over to that fork, they get to keep the name of the sub.  That way mods and admins are incentivized to act in the best interest of users at all time, because if they don't, they are easily deposed.  As a bonus it would also result in making new communities from two groups who shouldn't have been together in the first place. Essentially creating more and more specialized communities more closely matching the wants of the users.  This is different to Lemmy or Reddit where you would have to create a new sub, with zero content to depose a mod/split the community.  You essentially make the process to switch out mods as low cost as possible for users. Thereby massively increasing competition, increasing quality and user satisfaction.  Ideally this would all be built on top of some base data storage layer like IPFS or something, so you don't have to literally copy over all the content any time you fork a community, but you just copy the references to where the content is stored.  Also hosting should be as simple as possible, ideally on some decentralized hosting service, like some of these crypto solutions.   This would basically remove all barriers to creating and maintining your own communities, except for hosting cost and moderation.  If you had to design the perfect social media platform, I think that would be it.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

Not sure about the new sub if the existing users have migrated to the new sub thing.  'front page' feeds would need to change as well with this because a lot of the time people are upcoting stuff they agree with or find funny without looking at the sub it's been posted on.  This means a lot of subs could be deposed for generic meme subs just because they popular.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

Generally speaking, consideration for others is inversely proportional to the desperation of a given community. Think about how hard people have to work these days and still can't afford a decent place to live and food to eat. It makes perfect sense that someone who feels that the system is keeping them down, and wearing them to the bone won't be conscientious of how their actions will affect others. That mixed with Western ideals of extreme individualism, and a political climate that promotes divisiveness, it's truly a wonder that anyone has any consideration at all for their fellow countrymen.

Yeah that is a good point. I think it would need some permissions managment, like "only community members can vote" or "only community members can see posts". And those might be attached to every post or not depending on how the community is configured.   You also have the ability to restrict users based on certain rules or roles. Like on Reddit, no posting if your account is less than X days old, etc.. Certain members may be allowed to upvote but not post etc..  You may set it so new users can only see any posts made after they joined or not. And then they are also exempted from forking those posts.  Automatic timeouts for when posts should be deleted would also be nice. Also togglable community wise.  Basically setting the platform up to be as public or as private as the community wants.   Would be pretty complex though and not that essential. And might break the whole fork model.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

90s parody movies lean way too hard into deconstruction, and aren't very good at it. They're trying to say "here's how that would really go" but lack the patience to be clever. E.g. Scary Movie 3 having a character square off against the scary girl from The Ring. That's not a fully-formed joke. That's a three-second cutaway gag in Family Guy.   The clearest line between deconstruction and reconstruction might be Neon Genesis Evangelion versus Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.   Eva takes the cynicism and plausible physics of real-robot shows like Mobile Suit Gundam, and applies them to children piloting skyscraper-sized combat vehicles in monster-of-the-week battles. It doesn't kill off characters left and right, and the action is rarely gory or played for shock value, but there's a level of *emotional violence* that is unmatched outside of surrealism. It has an audience-insert protagonist specifically to go "this is you, and that is bad." The last few episodes are infamously a sharp left turn into abstract philosophy and, like... giving characters therapy. On some level Neon Genesis Evangelion is a mecha anime series that actively despises its audience for enjoying mecha anime.   Gurren went "yeah that's nice" and wrote a love letter to joyously stupid mecha anime. The universe literally runs on whatever sounds awesome. It is unselfconsciously goofy in a way that wraps back around to being cool as fuck. Now: it's not unaware of criticism. It was made by the same studio as Evangelion. But the key figures would eventually split off into Studio Trigger, whose output is primarily reconstructions - shows rooted in asking "how would this insane premise really work?" and then building a fun story within that universe.

I think in the US at least, people increasingly have accepted the notion that it's everyone for themselves, and any sense of "us together" is absent. And when you look at our national values and what sort of policy actually gets discussed and passed, it can be difficult to disagree with that idea. We have millions of Republicans who would do anything for Trump, but won't do the most minor thing to help their fellow citizens for example. We have a government that helps businesses, but won't help regular people.   And this sort of mentality is widespread throughout society. It gives people the idea of "You don't care about me, so why should I care about you?" In a moral vacuum, maybe the effect wouldn't be so pronounced, but in reality, it becomes an engine of apathy which gradually consumes more and more of the social consciousness and destroys the threads which hold that social contract together.

Was Lemmy not designed as a reddit clone?  Community/post/comment system with upvotes and downvotes, volunteer moderators, generally the same sorting filters, crossposting - hell, they even display your date of join as a "cake day".

Unfortunately, there are lots of situations in life where being a piece of shit gets you rewards.   That person cutting you off in traffic, grabbing the last item on the shelf when you were there first, cutting in line, cheating on their taxes, stealing the job you were in line to get, along with the infinite examples of this in the business world.

Yes, but from a slightly different viewpoint. Namely, people are so disenfranchised from their society on average that the idea of a social "contract" makes no sense. People are not at all represented by "their" governments, and in their righteous anger they conflate the oppression by governments with that of their people.   If you put on a crown and shout that you're better than me, I'm not going to respect your authority by default. You need to give a reason to do so, such as protections, rights, privileges, opportunities, camaraderie, etc.—or the implied or explicit threat of violence against those who disobey the law, as is the current setup. Right now, the only thing that my government does for me is wage wars in foreign lands, building ill will and corpse piles on my behalf. For many people, their government harasses them or just wants them straight-up dead.   I think that many people confuse the ill-will of governments with the avarice of their ordinary citizens [1]. It is, at best, tied to the *apathy* of their citizens, whom have themselves been relentlessly beaten into understandable submission.   The point I'm making is this: if people are already out to destroy you, what good is the social contract to you? Fuck them. This is the attitude that *drives* people not to care for others.   Now *this lack of care for others is* ***not*** *my viewpoint!* I *do* separate the actions of the state from the people they "represent" as much as is possible [2]. However, I'm in a position of relative comfort and privilege. I have the energy to take a fraction of a second and cool off when I start to see myself blaming humanity for things. Most people don't.   Lastly, in regards to situational awareness and common courtesy specifically...I really had to learn that, and I'm not the only one. "Do unto others as you would want done unto you" doesn't really work for me because I generally want different things than others. I have difficulties reading social cues. Even as an adult, I have to go far beyond "Do unto others..." to suss out what the right course of action is, because I typically would want something else or nothing to happen. Situational awareness and common courtesy are not inherently obvious or intuitive, and I think we do a disservice to ourselves by pretending that we don't generally learn courtesy from others.   [1] In areas where street justice is a thing, it is not at all uncommon for the public to side with non-state bullies in conducting oppression, although usually still with tacit state support.  [2] Patriots and ultranationalists do exist unfortunately. Non-state ultranationalists need to be taken to task along with their state-sponsored brethren.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

Do they not understand how they pay into a big pool so they all get benefits? Aka SOCIALISM???   Here's to being one of the good ones bud. Keep doing what you're doing and fuck the idiots.

All the time. There are things many people do which cause me (and others) physical pain because of a medical condition. They don't mean to cause me harm, but because they have a mental model of everyone sharing similar abilities as themselves, it simply doesn't occur to them that the one small thing they're doing has negative consequences for others. It's a monkeysphere thing, it's nobody's fault.  I get past it by remembering that I am also incapable of remembering everyone's needs at all times. I'm sure there are many things I have done which seemed completely mundane at the time, but affected someone else negatively. No matter how hard I tried.  The people who still do things like casually block the entire sidewalk with a heavy rental e-bike still pisses me off. But, not for as long as it used to. And if it's something I can fix for someone else who can't, I'll try to do that too.  I also try hard to ensure I actively remember other people's needs where I can. If I can create less suffering, I think that's a good thing to try for.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

This is the whole point of the post. Everyone should have an intrinsic desire to get out of each other's way, be courteous, be thoughtful of other's time, etc. The flip side is we ask our neighbors to be patient as we do our best in our day, and may have things slowing US down.   So the 1-2 punch is: be courteous to avoid bothering others, and be patient to understand that others are trying their best.   If everyone genuinely tries on both those topics, everyone feels _pretty good_ about their public interactions.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

I think the turning point to mainstream appeal will be when major existing websites switch their attached discussion forums to Lemmy, which will inject a huge amount of new users into the ecosystem.  Reddit initially wanted companies to be able to set up their own official subreddit as their official forum and the private subreddit system is designed for that function.   So, say something like cnn or tmz set up their own Lemmy instance where they only post their own content for people to discuss, as having that inbuilt existing userbase mitigates the most painful part of setting up a new social media. The share button might get replaced with "go to our lemmy instance" button, and the snowball will just get bigger and bigger.   The day that gets rolling is the end of web 2.0 social media as we know it.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

It's definitely gotten worse due to the dispersion of our social groups.  It used to be that we would interact with the same people for a large chunk of our lives. The guy you shoulder checked on the path was your dad's coworker etc. The social contract was a lot more reciprocal.  Now, we bounce around the city/country/world, almost on a whim. This breaks alot of the connections that reinforced the social contract.  In scientific terms, the Nash equilibrium has changed. The social contract is close to a classic prisoner dilemma situation. It used to be iterative, and so favour a "tit for tat" response. It is now closer to multiple random individual interactions. This favours "defection" more, since the other person will never get a chance to respond.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

Location dependent, but I would say it has always been like this. It's just more visible when everyone can film it and comment on incidents globally.

To be brief, I have a painful condition where I injure myself by standing or walking for too long. If I overdo it I can be (and have been, many times) confined to bed for days.  It isn't something you would ever really think about if you weren't in my position, but society really assumes you can stand for as long as you need to. Seating is a "convenience" for 90% of people, not a necessity.  Public spaces will frequently only a couple of seats, which will already be taken by others like me. An invite to a random bar by a friend can be a huge problem, queueing is even more hellish than for most people, kitchens are built with the assumption you will be standing to cook... limited standing ability has much wider reaching consequences than you would ever think.  Anytime someone sits in a seat just for convenience instead of need is painful, because there are usually very few. Anytime someone holds an event and does not organise for seating means I have to leave. Others plan routes around cost and walking time, I do it by seating opportunities. Even something tiny like parents letting their bored kids climb and play all over the only bench in an art gallery means I will be in more pain, because the gallery designers assume you stand to view the works.  I don't get out much. One of the worst parts is that you can't prevent your mind from linking physical pain to all activity. When peak covid hit and shops and parks etc. barred off seating areas to "prevent people from congregating", that was not a good time for me.  Sorry, didn't mean to unload, that just sort of spilled out. It looks like I have some self-care to do.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
What lemmy or kbin need is more users, plain and simple.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
Monthly subscriptions aren't bad - they're the solution to removing the avalanche of ads we are inundated by. The user gets to pick and choose which services they want to use.    One of the problems is opening up services to free users so you can keep them captured and squash competition, and at the same time push subscriptions to them via ads constantly.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
Why not both!	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
That's because it's still new and not super user friendly/a little confusing. I am still figuring things out here, but I love it because the tone and vibe remind me of the older net before it became super accessible and the unwashed masses started to outnumber the real nerds.  I've seen it happen with many sites, boards, communities, etc. A haven is created, it becomes popular, it has a golden age, it becomes flooded with idiots/spam/bots/trash, dies, and a new place arises and the cycle starts again. I watched it happen with icq, AOL chat rooms (and AOL itself), MySpace, Facebook, reddit, YouTube...  Some take longer than others to go through parts of the cycle, but they always do.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
I think that may be stemming from the earlier changes when they shut down a large number of fairly popular but controversial subs, that drove some active commenters away. Plus they started getting very ban happy in the last couple of years, that absolutely has a damping effect	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
One positive to this is that with each new beginning the technology has improved, and there is a richer ecosystem of features as things have been iterated on over the years.  The customizability of the UI on Lemmy for example is awesome. It is a brave new world right now, and I am excited to see where the platform goes, and what cool new things we all discover together as we walk this road of building a new and hopefully vibrant community.

Web 3 is different things depending on who you ask. Block chain, decentralization, or whatever else. We dunno, we aren't there yet. I personally believe federated services have a chance of being web 3 (and Blockchain is not relevant).  Web 2 is basically big tech on the internet, everything becoming centralized. Everything became easy to use for the end user, all point and click.  Web 1 was the stuff prior to that, when the internet was the wild west.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

You only feel bound by the social contract of the community / communities of which you actually feel part in your day to day.

The software architect of lemmy is unfortunately doomed. The very concept of how it works means exponential storage and bandwidth needs as it grows in sublemmits and instances.  A better design would have been instances being the sublemmits themselves, and leaving it up to the clients to subscribe and aggregate them into a feed. This way scaling is a lot more horizontal, and communities that get too big can scale up individually or purge old data without affecting the rest of the system.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
I assume this is a larger theme across the Fediverse?  Could you expand on what causes the massive bandwidth needs? I'm have a vague idea but I'd be very curious to know.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
You can be king forever, with consent of the users.  For a long time Reddit was fairly altruistic.  I supported them with a subscription, and was proud to be a member. Reddit gold was an amazing way to monetize with the full support of the community.  As things tend to go, eventually the leadership got greedy and began to care more about money than their life's work.  Reddit got to where it is *because they did* listen to the community and have public support. They've only squandered that in the last few years.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
It should try to grow larger than in currently is, but not try to be a top website.  Trying to do the latter will involve clashing with online legal regulations, politicians, and compliance to a much greater extent than is required now. Furthermore, it will be inundated with "normie" culture if it strives to be as popular. If you make it accessible to the lower common denominator, you get the lowest common denominator.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
Reddit just faked it all until it made it basically. The creators of it are even on the record talking about it.  Lemmy could do the same if it wanted.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

> The shopping cart test for a community. [...] Culture is learned from your peer group.  Perfect example... Germany universally has this deposit system for their shopping carts but bypassed the handling and inserting of a coin into the cart at the height of covid.  Since then I have barely seen any reversal there. People still return their carts although they don't need to get their coin back where the system is still disabled. Or they just conveniently forget to use the system and still bring their carts back without locking them there where the system is operational again.  The actual deposit was basically only needed for the learning phase. After this it just works automatically.	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
I know. I went through this before when Digg killed itself off and everyone migrated to the underdog, reddit.

At least colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Wyoming by court.   And quite a lot if european countries (some only at beaches and pools etc.)  https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/free-the-nipple-states  Lots of states also are very ambiguous with their laws or don’t actively prosecute them. In any way: It’s s a stupid law and no one is hurt by topless or even nude people in the streets. I don’t find it appealing for myself but if others like it, let them have it.

I think that's partly because Last Jedi took all the setup work of TFA, and tossed it contemptuously over its shoulder and off a cliff!   There was plenty to work with there, Rey beginning her journey with Luke, Luke troubled by the past, Snoke as a mysterious new villain, Kylo Ren as a bad guy wannabe who's torn by his conscience - but Rian Johnson (whom I really rate as a director in general, Brick and Knifes Out in particular) just tossed most of it aside, or undermined it.   That and the pointless casino planet episode, and the awful, awful humour ("Can you hear me now?" jokes? In Star Wars?) just brought it all to a shuddering halt IMO.   Then in the third film, JJA seemed to be trying to get things back on track a bit, but he was starting from such a bad position, it was always going to be a challenge.   From that point of view (which I know may not the universal one) I think Rise of Skywalker was a minor miracle. 	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
2 movies immediately come to mind, and I think it's because I went in with an expectation that the movie is gonna suck. 1. Pacific Rim 2. District 9  It's probably been 10 years since I watched either of those movies so I'm not sure how they have aged... 	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

Grosse Pointe Blank - I was expecting a cheesy action movie.  That is in there, although it's a better than it has any right to be.  And at the same time it manages to be a good romantic comedy.

Was there a massive behind-the-scenes NWO plan between billionnaires, old aristocracy and top politicians to fuck up the world, reduce population etc? No, the world ran its natural, chaotic course for most of history. Is there this kind of conspiracy now? ABSOLUTELY YES. In 2023 it is not possible to have any influence and not be aware of the climate disaster. Anyone who does have big influence and does not act to mitigate warming and its consequences is doing it willingly and with full conscience. Doubly so if they act to worsen the situation. It's almost like the elites read some of the crackhead theories and thought "hey, this is actually a decent plan!"	"{""toxic_content"":false}"

The use of content warnings on !asklemmy --- ### TL;DR  Use spoilers for NSFW content that is "within reason" and doesn't break Rule 1 like this :  >   \::: spoiler My NSFW warning > >   My NSFW comment or post content > >   :::  This will look like (click the triangle)  :::  spoiler My NSFW warning  My NSFW comment or post content  :::  ---       ## The longer version The community rules which seem to need to be balanced by the mods most are: 1) Be nice &amp; have fun, and 4) NSFW is okay, within reason.  The lemmy.world site rules also state:  ---  **We are not a free speech zone**. This CoC lays out expected standards of conduct and behavior. You cannot say or post anything that violates these rules or principles and remain a member of our community. You must follow this CoC. If you are looking for something else, please do. It is not here.  **The Moderators are not morality or thought police**. Moderators are guided by this Code of Conduct. Post what you want, if what you post follows these rules, principles and the goals outlined above. Not every member of the community will appreciate controversial or explicit posts so **use Content Warnings very liberally**. We use Content Warnings so community members themselves can decide whether they want to see or engage with a post that may be controversial or explicit.  **Bullies, trolls and disruptors are not welcome**. We will moderate accordingly.  **This is a voluntary community**. You chose to be here. When you choose to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.  ---  Moderators seek to apply these, sometimes conflicting, rules.  In doing so we take the balance of probabilities approach.  The majority of comments which have been removed to date have been a clear breach of community Rule 1, however sometimes balancing the requirement to be accepting of NSFW content and the requirement for participants to be nice can be difficult.  To make this easier, posters and commentors are encouraged to use the spoiler functionality in markdown to create a content warning on asklemmy.  Posts that use a spoiler are less likely to be removed when considering whether they are "within reason" NSFW.  To create a spoiler, use three colons ":" followed by the word "spoiler" and then the warning text to create a content warning.  Type your comment(s) on the lines below and then three colons at the end to end the spoiler.  ---  >   \::: spoiler My NSFW warning > >   My NSFW omment or post content > >   :::  ---  This will look like   :::  spoiler My NSFW warning  My NSFW comment or post content  :::	"{""toxic_content"":false}"
